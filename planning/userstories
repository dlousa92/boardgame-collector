As a harcore User, I want to be able to upload a new game I buy to my collection. I also want to be able to log the game when I play it so I can come back to my collection later and be able to see which games I play the most. I'd like to be able to see what the friends I've added on my friend list are playing and what they think about certain games. I'd like to be able to rate the games in my collection and sort them by highest rated, or most played/least played. I want to have the functionality available to delete a game when I sell it. 

As a casual User I'd like to check what the top games are in the hobby, and use that information to possibly make a purchase. I'd like to see a short description on what the game is and the mechanics it uses.
